# Glossary
This project done using OSU CSE Components â€“ API Specification.

A program that takes in a text file and outputs a group of html files. There shall be a top-level index which merely lists each term in the glossary, and separate pages for each of the terms with their definitions. Clicking on a term in the index shall take you to the page for that term and its associated definition. Moreover, clicking on any term in the glossary that happens to appear in a definition shall take you to the page for that term and its associated definition.
